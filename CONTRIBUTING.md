## How to contribute

This project is open to contribution from anyone, as long as you cover your changes with specs and if it is a bigger change with scenario. Your pull requests will be merged after your code passes CI and manual code review.

Every change merges to master. No development is done in other branches.

## Typical contribution use case

- You need a feature that is not implemented yet
- Search for open/closed issues relating to what you need
- If you don't find anything, create new issue
- Fork this repository and create fix/feature in the fork
- Write tests/scenarios for your change
- If you changed API, document the change in README
- Create pull request, describe what you did
- Wait for CI to verify you didn't break anything
    - If you did, rewrite it
- If CI passes, wait for manual review by repo's owner
- Your pull request will be merged into master
